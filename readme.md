Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries (Visual Studio Fork)
----

*See the official README [here](https://github.com/sraboy/7kaa/blob/master/README).*

This is a personal fork of the [official repo](https://github.com/the3dfxdude/7kaa). The default branch is [visual_studio](https://github.com/sraboy/7kaa/tree/visual_studio) while the [master](https://github.com/sraboy/7kaa/tree/master) branch tracks the official repo.

The visual_studio branch contains Solution and Project files for VS2010, VS2013 and VS2015. In order to use VS2015, I had to acquire SDL2 libraries compiled for/with VS2015. See this [7kfans.com forum post](https://www.7kfans.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=697&start=10) for more information. The repo already contains these libraries and they've tested fine with VS2013 and VS2015.

I do not maintain the VS2010 solution but one of 7KAA's primary developers does [in this repo](https://github.com/microvirus/7kaa). Credit goes to Microvirus for the original VS2010 solution which I bogarted and upgraded for the newer VS products. 

A couple notes:

* Visual Studio is not officially supported by the project (so no PRs with all the VS stuff).
* I've enabled the Issues tracker on this repo but it is not part of the official project. I occasionally work on unofficial features/changes and wanted a place to track my own issues.
